# Payroll Application
This application will be able to handle basic payroll tasks using a database as storage system.

## AWS Database Information
The application will utilize Amazon Web Services's (AWS) Relational Database System.  This will allow the information stored in the database to be accessed anywhere that a user has access to the internet.  This is to hopefully allow this application to be a web-based application upon completion of this project.
