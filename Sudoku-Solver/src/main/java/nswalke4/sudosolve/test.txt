First off, we need to discuss some \"rules\". The importing
will occur row-by-row, with an entire row being brought in
at one time. An entire row should be input before pressing
the 'enter' key. Inside each row, you may separate out the
numbers by either spaces or commas. All of our values that
are unknown should be represented by a 0. Pressing 'enter'
(or 'return') will 'parse' that row and inform you of any
issues. If you see the '>>', you will know that the
previous row has been accepted and you can input the next
row. If the previous row was unsuccessful for any reason,
the program will inform you, and you will have to input
that row again. After all 9 rows have been input, the
puzzle will be presented to you to ensure that it is
correct.  At that point, you will have the ability to
choose an incorrect cell and adjust it directly.
