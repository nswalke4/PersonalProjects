# Sudoku Solver

This is a basic command-line application with the ability to solve a Sudoku puzzle.

## Solving a Puzzle

In order to solve a puzzle, this application provides the user 2 separate ways to input the puzzle that they would like to be solved.

### Manual Entry

After beginning the program, the user can select "Manual Entry" to allow them to input the data directly into the CLI they are using.  Instructions are provided to the user if they choose to use this entry method.

### Importing a Puzzle

Included in this directory is a text file that users can manipulate to input their desired data.  Users should make sure not to adjust the pattern in any way, or to change the file name.  Once the user begins the application in the CLI, they can choose the "Import Entry" method, and the application will pull in the data from the text file that the user updated.
