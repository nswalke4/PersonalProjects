## Directions

Modify the C++ Program from the [Section 9 Challenge](../Section9Challenge/README.md) to be modularized.  Use functions instead of block statements inside each of the swich cases.  The `list` should be kept in the main function and not be a global variable.  Use function prototypes to declare the functions before the `main` funciton, and then write the functions below the `main` function.  Remember to pass by reference the list, and to make it a constant whenever it is not necessary to modify the list.
