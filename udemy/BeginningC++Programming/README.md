## About

This directory contains all of the work completed for the "Beginning C++ Programming" Udemy course.  The work contained was developed by me in attempts to complete the challenges given.  The purpose of taking this couse was to expand my knowledge and gain some understanding with one of the most complex and used programming languages in the world.  As a student at ASU, most of my coursework was completed using Java and Javascript, with some experience in C.  My current job has had me working mostly inside of Qt using QML and JavaScript, but there is an extensive codebase with much of our code utilizing C++.  In an attempt to better understand the overall code, I decided taking a course in C++ would be beneficial not only for my current job, but also my future as a Software Engineer.
