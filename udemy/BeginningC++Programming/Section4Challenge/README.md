## Directions

Create a C++ program that asks the user for their favorite number between 1 and 100 then read this number from the console.

Suppose the user enters '24', display the following to the console:

```text
    Amazing!!  That's my favorite number too!
    No really!!  24 is my favorite number!
```

## Examples

```text
    Enter your favorite number between 1 and 100:  24
    Amazing!!  That's my favorite number too!
    No really!!  24 is my favorite number!
```

```text
    Enter your favorite number between 1 and 100:  69
    Amazing!!  That's my favorite number too!
    No really!!  69 is my favorite number!
```
