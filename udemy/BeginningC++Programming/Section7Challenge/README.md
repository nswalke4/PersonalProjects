## Directions

Write a C++ program based on the following instructions:

- Declare 2 empty vectors of integers named `vector1` and `vector2`, respectively.
- Add `10` and `20` to `vector1` dynamically using `push_back()`
- Display the elements of `vector1` using the `at()` method as well as its size using the `size()` method
- Add `100` and `200` to `vector2` dynamically using `push_back()`
- Display the elements of `vector2` using the `at()` method as well as its size using the `size()` method
- Declare an empty 2D vector called `vector_2d`
- Add `vector1` to `vector_2d` dynamically using `push_back()`
- Add `vector2` to `vector_2d` dynamically using `push_back()`
- Display the elements of `vector_2d` using the `at()` method
- Change `vector1.at(0)` to `1000`
- Display the elements of `vector_2d` again using the `at()` method
- Display the elements of `vector1`
- Answer the following questions:
    - What did you expect?
    - Did the results show what you expected?
    - What do you think happened?
