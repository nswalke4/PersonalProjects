## Directions

Write a C++ Program that will provide the user with the number and type of coins needed to create the amount requested.

_NOTE: Assume that number of cents will be greater than or equal to 0._

## Example

A sample run for user entering 92 cents:

```text
    Enter an amount in cents:  92

    You can provide this change as follows:
         dollars: 0
        quarters: 3
           dimes: 1
         nickels: 1
         pennies: 2
```
