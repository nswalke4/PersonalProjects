***NOTE: I did not notice the comment about solving this using the modulo operator until after completing the assignment using my while loops.  Therefore, I attempted to resolve using the modulo operator, which is why there is additional time listed next the the "Time to Complete".  Both versions have been tested and work properly.  I left the modulo version uncommented as I felt it was the more effecient method.***

## Directions

Write a C++ Program that will provide the user with the number and type of coins needed to create the amount requested.

_NOTE: Assume that number of cents will be greater than or equal to 0._

## Example

A sample run for user entering 92 cents:

```text
    Enter an amount in cents:  92

    You can provide this change as follows:
         dollars: 0
        quarters: 3
           dimes: 1
         nickels: 1
         pennies: 2
```
