# React Calculator Application

Welcome to my first React application!! In this project, I have developed a basic web application that acts as a basic calculator. The purpose of this project was to test out a new language (javascript), as well as to gather a better understanding of html and css format.

### About the Calculator

The main goal of this project was to develop a web application. The actual logic behind a complicated calculator was not the main objective. This means that this calculator is pretty basic. It does complete basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the correct order of operations, allows the user to use negative numbers, and even gives the users the ability to square a number by hitting equal after selecting the multiplication sign. However, it is not very informative to the user if there is an error -- it only provides a "Syntax Error" message. Overall, this is a basic calculator that works properly, but there are limitations as to what it can do.

NOTE: When presenting the answer, the result will be cut to 12 digits max -- this could create some minor rounding issues. For example, the value '5.3999999999999999998' would be '5.4' in the result screen.

### Running the Project

Currently, this project is not running online to be used. However, you can download this directory and be able to run the application on your own network. I personally used "npm" to build and develop this application. With "npm" installed in your computer, you can run this application using the command "npm run build".
