### About the Developer

Hello! My name is Nicholas Walker. I am 29 years old, and am in the middle of a career-transition! I spent 10 years in the Restaurant business and was quite sucessful, but never felt really challenged. In January of 2020, I began my degree in Software Engineering and fell in love. I am now in my senior year of classes and expect to be graduating in December of 2022!
