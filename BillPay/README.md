## About
This project will develop an application to keep track of bills.  This will be
able to track due dates and missed payments based on a user updating the app
whenever they complete payments.  It will also provide users with a summary
email that will inform them which payments are past due, due today, and will
be due in the future.  This email can be sent based on the user's preference
(daily, weekley, etc).  The plan is to have the app utilize Google Sheets as
the database for holding the account informaiton.

_More information will be provided as development is finalized._
